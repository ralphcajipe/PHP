In this mode, his chakra is amplified and he can access the power of the nine-tailed beast. He's incredibly strong in this form, and he's able to take on some of the strongest opponents. Naruto is a force to be reckoned with when he's in this mode. The chakra is so strong that it's even visible, and it surrounds him like a cloak.</p>";
